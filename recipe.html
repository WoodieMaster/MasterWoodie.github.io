        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol class="text-block">
            <li>Mix brown sugar, fajita seasoning, and paprika in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Rub both sides of pork spareribs with the brown sugar mixture.</li>
            <li>Place spareribs in a 9x13-inch baking pan; cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk together beer, garlic, honey, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard in a bowl; Set that aside</li>
            <li>Tear off 2 large sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil and lay them shiny-side down.</li>
            <li>Place a rack of spare ribs on each sheet, meaty-side up.</li>
            <li>Tear off 2 more sheets of foil and place them on top of the spare ribs, shiny-side up.</li>
            <li>Begin tightly folding the edges of the foil together to create a sealed packet.</li>
            <li>Just before sealing completely, divide beer mixture evenly into each packet.</li>
            <li>Complete the seal.</li>
            <li>Place the packets side-by-side on an 11x14-inch baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake ribs in the preheated oven until the ribs are very tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Carefully open each packet and drain drippings into a saucepan.</li>
            <li>You may only need the drippings from one packet.</li>
            <li>Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the saucepan over medium-high and simmer drippings until the sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Brush the thickened sauce over ribs.</li>
            <li>Preheat the broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.</li>
            <li>Return ribs to the oven and broil until the sauce is lightly caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
